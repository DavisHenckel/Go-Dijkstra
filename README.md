# Go-Dijkstra
Project to learn Go as well as to experiment with dijkstras shortest path algoirthm.

## Goals
- Build a random adjacency matrix to represent an undirected graph
- Adjacency matrix will be symmetric.
- Use this matrix to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm 
- Follow TDD practices
- Follow Go best practices
